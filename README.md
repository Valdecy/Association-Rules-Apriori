# Association-Rules-Apriori

Apriori algorithm an Association Rule Learning over Transactions Databases.The Function returns: 1) A list with the Association Rules and 2) The Same list with the following interestingness measures - a)"Frequence", b) "Support (Antecedent)", c) "Support (Consequence)", d) "Support", e) "Confidence", f) "All Confidence", g) "Cosine", h) "Lift" and i) "Conviction".

* Xdata = Transactions Database. If the Transactions Database is in the 0-1 format, follow the "Example 1)" in the end of the Python-DM-Association Rules-01.py file. However if the Transaction Database is in the list format, follow the "Example 2)" in the end of the Python-DM-Association Rules-01.py file.

* min_freq = The minimal quantity of times that a Transaction may occur in order to be considered important. High Values will speed up the calculations.
