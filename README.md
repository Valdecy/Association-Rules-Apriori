# Association-Rules-Apriori
Apriori Algorithm an Association Rule Learning Over Transactions Databases.The Function returns: 1) A List with the Association Rules and 2) The Same List with the following interestingness measures - a)"Frequence", b) "Suport(Antecedent)", c) "Suport(Consequence)", d) "Suport", e) "Confidence", f) "All Confidence", g) "Cosine", h) "Lift", i) "Conviction" and j) "Interestingness".

* Xdata = Transactions Database. If the Transactions Database is in the 0-1 Format, Follow the "Example 1)" in the End of the Python-DM-Association Rules-01.py File. However if the Transaction Database is in the List Format, Follow the "Example 2)" in the End of the Python-DM-Association Rules-01.py File.

* min_freq = The Minimal Quantity that a Transaction May Occur. High Values Will Speed Up the Calculations.
